**Open Source Definition**
When most people think of open source, they typically just think of a project with public source code. However, truly open-source software fits into specific criteria regarding distribution and use of the source code. Without adhering to these ten principles a project cannot be considered open source.

**Smart Questions**
The article was an interesting read. Over the years I've learned most of the tips the author described when asking questions. I did however find the author to sound a bit egocentric at times. I've stumbled across questions on Stack Exchange that I've found totally reasonable that were met with heavy backlash in the responses because they didn't provide enough detail or thought the OP didn't do their DD in trying to find an answer before asking. Personally I wouldn't spend any of my time chewing someone out for inefficiently asking questions, but it seems like the author would disagree with me. 

**Answering Questions**
1. If applicable, provide background context. Often times people will answer questions with prior knowledge and apply that prior knowledge to their answer; this can confuse the OP and lead them down a rabbit hole of trying to justify the answer you've provided.
2. Gauge how much the person knows by thoroughly reading their question. If the question is very specific and technical then you'd be safe to assume you can use more technical vocabulary in your answer. Conversely, if the question seems general or doesn't involve technical depth, keep the answer light and understandable. 

**Free Culture**
Surprisingly I've never heard this story before (and I would say I know quite a bit of RPI lore). It's a good example outlining the importance of understanding the product you're building and how it can potentially branch into the realm of copyright infringement. Of course, at the time copyright infringement wasn't on Jesse's radar - he was building something that used preexisting technology that used data that was already available. After reading the chapter, I was curious about how the RIAA even discovered the project and piracy in the first place. It seems like it would be a small-time case even though they attempted to get one-hundred billion dollars out of it. I was also wondering what RPI's stance on the matter was. As the author said, it was a student tinkering with technology which is exactly what the institution would promote so you would think RPI would back him in the lawsuit in the name of protecting their students and innovation.

An interesting project I'd like to evaluate is [BakkesModSDK](https://github.com/bakkesmodorg/BakkesModSDK). Bakkesmod is a DLL injector for Rocket League which provides additional freeplay functionality to practice game-like scenarios. Overtime users like myself have requested more features within the mod for a more customizable freeplay experience. The developers released this SDK as a solution for users to develop plugins on top of the mod to create their own variations. This is appealing to me because I've always loved toying around in freeplay with this mod and have thought of suggestions they can be built on top of the existing functionality.

2. Licensing is imperative for the general public to understand how that can interact with IP. 
Without licensing, the public cannot assume anything about what is acceptable usage; any improper usage could result in legal trouble. With a license, however,
people will know exactly what quantifies acceptable usage and what falls in the bounds of legally acceptable usage.

3. Using a project that does not have explicit licensing can potentially put you in legal trouble. By default the source code for a project
is under copyright. This means nobody except the author(s) are allowed to use the source code. 

4. I absolutely agree with the claims in the article. Opening up the development to the public would have been hugely beneficial for two reasons;
the first being that user-feedback could be directly implemented (with the approval of the dev team) into the application in the form of contributions by the public.
Secondly, as mentioned in the article, it would open up more time for the original developers to make continuous improvements and address technical debts by alleviating some of the developmental burden.
Instead, they took it all on themselves and couldn't keep up with the demands of the userbase. 

5. Based on the history of Linux and its predecessors, it makes sense for it to be licensed under the GPL. Linux utilizes certain GNU components
which is why it's practical to be under GNU GPL. Precursors to Linux like MINIX had publicly available source code but restrictive licensing
that did not allow for redistribution among other things. Torvalds was motivated to create a separate OS because he became frustrated with the licensing
of systems like MINIX, which is why he prioritized permissive licensing for his OS.

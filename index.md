My name is Nick Lennox and I'm currently a fourth-year CS major. I'm from Worcester, MA and have one older sister and an older brother (who was also a CS major). This is my last semester at RPI which is both exciting and bittersweet because I'll be leaving behind great memories and friends. Outside of schoolwork I enjoy gaming (most notably Rocket League and Rust) and playing/watching soccer. After graduation I'll be moving to Boston to work full-time for IBM where I am currently doing a software engineering co-op.
